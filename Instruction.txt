This is Nike Frontend React Project
Since it is not a full stack project we are using VITE for this : https://vitejs.dev/guide/

Install it from instruction given on website
(Install Node.js If not installed ever before)

1. For Nike : npm create vite@latest => cd project => npm i to install rest packages  => npm run dev to start

Google font poppins for  fonts

2. we will use modules css for contact project these are helpful in case of global => what we will do in app.css will act as global ans can be directly used in components ex contaainer in this 
use react icons for icons: npm i react-icons


3. We are making a dice game
-> we are going to use styled components very imp.... 

SelectNumber.jsx important
key is importantto give in Box as to identify each one with unique else give error
in box isselected act as prop to box 

when argument in click use  onClick={()=>setSelectednumber(value)} this syntax to update use state ==> set((prev)=> prev+1) syntax
for background use uiGradients site


4. API project
we got server folder from yt channel which will host api at port 9000
so we will use api url as http://localhost:9000/

we used useEffect in fetching api as useEffect is a tool which runs the function before the ui of page loads so we want to fetch data before ui and passing [] means run it once only else infinite loop of call of use effect happen
{data?.map(value,index) => <Card>{value.text}</Card>} this means if data is not null then use map
use flex wrap as wrap to make responsive

toFixed(2) for decimal upto 2 places
border box is that h ans w do not change on padding and margin
row-gap: ; for flex row gap //ly col gap
Data?.filter((value) => value.type.toLowercase().includes(type.toLowercase()));  //filter those value that include same type as btn clicked


project 4 ->

Tailwind :  set tailwind from website : framework guide --> vite -> create app with template as given : tailwind css apply when you write in class name use extension Tailwind CSS IntelliSense for auto
ans tailwind prettier from docs of  website : npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss  
EX: <div className='flex bg-red-600 justify-center'>APP</div>
add tailwindcss() in viteconfig plugins
import tailwindcss from 'tailwindcss';

Firebase: website->getstarted -> after prpject setup-> click web icon (</>)-> register-> npm i firebase -> copy given code to -> src ->config folder create-> firebase.js
now create a database in frebase -> go  to main page of project -> bulid -> firebase database (node sql database)
-> create db -> test mode when practice / production mode for real apps(they have that google login features so one user on profile data) -> mumbai server
start collection to store data -> write id name like contacts -> auto ID -> now add fields like name and email for trial;
import firestore in firebase.js
and export

then frontend part
add colors from figma to tailwind extend

//////// To add browser into vs code: shift +ctrl + P -> type simple browser add url EX: http://localhost:5173/
To add manual value in tailwind css use []

useffect in appjsx is how you get data from firebase databse;

we aslo used Modal => it is a popup on screen which we used to take input for new data : react chakra ui : modal
we create a custom modal : for modal use portal and update root-modal in index.html it is done for better ui as position abs and rel of normal root hinders modal

use formik for form used in addandupdate.jsx


Now for edit btn we again need modal to open and will need isopen usestate and close and open fn again in contactarea.jsx
to prevent it from writing again and again same thing we use hooks

on adding updating etc we nedd to refresh to see changes so we use firebase property: onsnapshot in app.jsx

for ui to show to user task done use Rweact tostify install it;
also need to add toast container in app jsx
also need to import css of toast see here: https://www.copycat.dev/blog/react-toastify/

we used "Yup" for validation of data such that koi empty name/email na daale

project-5 : use react npm hamburger for side nav responsive :npm i hamburger-react
for drawer:npm i @material-tailwind/react (https://www.material-tailwind.com/docs/react/guide/cra) and npm i @heroicons/react
also setup in tailwind config and themeprovider in main.jsx

also used tabs in project in tabs.jsx=> initial value 1D selected
bgimage + gradient: bg-[linear-gradient(to_right_bottom,rgba(49,84,44,0.8),rgba(16,71,52,0.8)),url('/images/grid_bg.svg')]

for multi page use react router dom


in tabcontent we had too many renders so we used use effect
to make text nowrap use whitespace



////// imp: on mobile 100vh include addresss bar so we use 100svh /////////
