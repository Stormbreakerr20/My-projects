This is Nike Frontend React Project
Since it is not a full stack project we are using VITE for this : https://vitejs.dev/guide/

Install it from instruction given on website
(Install Node.js If not installed ever before)

1. For Nike : npm create vite@latest => cd project => npm i to install rest packages  => npm run dev to start

Google font poppins for  fonts

2. we will use modules css for contact project these are helpful in case of global => what we will do in app.css will act as global ans can be directly used in components ex contaainer in this 
use react icons for icons: npm i react-icons


3. We are making a dice game
-> we are going to use styled components very imp.... 

SelectNumber.jsx important
key is importantto give in Box as to identify each one with unique else give error
in box isselected act as prop to box 

when argument in click use  onClick={()=>setSelectednumber(value)} this syntax to update use state ==> set((prev)=> prev+1) syntax
for background use uiGradients site


4. API project
we got server folder from yt channel which will host api at port 9000
so we will use api url as http://localhost:9000/

we used useEffect in fetching api as useEffect is a tool which runs the function before the ui of page loads so we want to fetch data before ui and passing [] means run it once only else infinite loop of call of use effect happen
{data?.map(value,index) => <Card>{value.text}</Card>} this means if data is not null then use map
use flex wrap as wrap to make responsive

toFixed(2) for decimal upto 2 places
border box is that h ans w do not change on padding and margin
row-gap: ; for flex row gap //ly col gap
Data?.filter((value) => value.type.toLowercase().includes(type.toLowercase()));  //filter those value that include same type as btn clicked
