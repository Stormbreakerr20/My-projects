cd server 
npm i
npm run dev to start server 
then postman.json-> reveal in explorer
import in postman and drag and drop

if url not working go to environment-> new env var= url type: def initail value= currentvalue http://localhost:9000
from top right select env as name of env

we will use react query npm i react-query in crypto
can chek docs

wrap in app.jsx
from main page and dev tools in docs

now on running app you will see a flower at left bottom

now npm i axios through which api call will be made
now set up axios in api folder in src

in axios or any use env folder rather than direct url process.env.BACKEND_URL is for create react APP in vite import.meta.env aand preffix in url

create two types of query in Query folder
Now make a example network call in Dashboard using useEffect

Now in place of useEffect we use  useQuery : it require queryfunction and qkey with value an array: we get many options with that one of it is .isLoading

Now create function for each and go to that particular like sigin function created then got to Login.jsx
useMutation for calls except get : like in login.jsx {mutate,isLoading,error,isError} we get these from useMutation
mutate is used in onSubmit of form

check from postman keys of form and db keys must match 

onsucces usenavigate 

to send email from signup to verification use State of navigate and location in Email.jsx

in email.jsx we use useQuery hook as we don't want any event as directly trigger it in place of mutation however we want ressend so use mutation is better
we use useEffect to trigger it for first time

when we send verification mail we get a url which has a token at end but contains . so we use a method from stack overflow and it is done in registration.js
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-rewrite-all

add to vite.config
import pluginRewriteAll from 'vite-plugin-rewite-all';

in registration.jsx use params to get token from link ,we use use Query as we want it to directly done


there was a bug in location part in email.jsx so now we will take email from params

in verify-user-mail there is an error type verfiy-...

(npm i react-spinners)

Note : token = "" token1="nojwnr"
console.log(!!token) // false
console.log(!!token1) //true    // used for exist or not !! give bool

not done in this project protected one can see dosomecoding video
Now after everything done we will use usecontext,npm i  react-cookie and jwt-decode this are to ensure only logged in user can acces app and to protect user
context values van be accessed anywhere in app just wrap it in main.jsx (our is in provider)
example of it's use in Dashboard.jsx
jwtdecode to get data from token not 

Email.js to send mail
