npm i framer-motion for animations motion is used for different task
npm i valtio it act as context in react provide proxy to define keys, usesnapshot to get a static or current values of those keys anywhere in react app
public asset config folders are pre made
create store, pages, comp, canvas folders

animation can be applied like this in home.jsx
      <motion.section {...slideAnimation("down")}>
        <motion.div {...slideAnimation("left")}>
          <img src="./threejs.png" alt="" className="h-8 w-8 object-contain" />
        </motion.div>
      </motion.section>

in customizer.jsx each motion.div must given a key as we are returning multiple divs so animate can identify each one uniquely

more packeges to be installed like 
npm i three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath
//////////////////////////////////////////////
combo of two powerful things react and three js : Three.js is a JavaScript library used for 3D graphics : react-threejs is used to make 3d graphics easy in react

In summary, react-three/fiber allows developers to create interactive 3D web applications using the familiar React syntax. It simplifies the process of building 3D scenes, managing animations, and handling user interactions in a way that aligns with how React handles UI components.
react-three/fiber used in canvas 

react-three/drei : In summary, react-three-drei is an extension of react-three/fiber that makes working with 3D graphics in React applications more convenient. It offers a collection of pre-built components, hooks, and helpers that streamline the process of building interactive and visually stunning 3D scenes and animations, enabling developers to create impressive 3D experiences with ease.

then we created few three js components as jsx like backdrop in canvas
<ambientLight intensity={0.5}/>
<Environment preset='city'/> are to spread color in entire page /// Read about them in Chat gpt

maath: https://github.com/pmndrs/maath is basically for math in threejs :This is a collection of useful math helpers, random generators, bits and bobs.

The useFrame :  hook allows you to define a function that will be called on every frame update, allowing you to apply dynamic changes to your scene, such as updating object positions, rotations, or any other visual effects.

.glb in public is shirt, we use it using useGLTF in shirt.jsx

CameraRig is to increase it's size

useFrame need input as state and delta state is not the proxy wali/ store wali state : (state: RootState, delta: number)

easing.dampE(dampE(current: Euler, target: [x: number, y: number, z: number, order?: EulerOrder | undefined] | Euler, smoothTime?: number | undefined, delta?: number | undefined, maxSpeed?: number | undefined, easing?: ((t: number) => number) | undefined, eps?: number | undefined))

npm i react-color for color picker
read file in customizer
background={null} was missing from Environment that's why there was an error
